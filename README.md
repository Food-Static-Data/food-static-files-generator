- [ ] We need to update readme here!
- [ ] plugin should generate files outside
- [x] replace configGenerator with callbacks because all methods will be passed from the outside
- [ ] husky, lint-staged should work again

- [x] Remove Debug/Output/Play folder and replace them with tests suits
<!--prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,scss,less}\"-->

## Quick Start

Several quick start options are available:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/GroceriStar/food-static-files-generator.git`
- Install with npm: `npm install @groceristar/static-data-generator`
- Install with yarn: `yarn add @groceristar/static-data-generator`

## How to split json into single elements

To split json file you will require `sd/generator/writeFile.js` . Call the function **split()** with parameters `path`(as string),`filename`(as string) and a `flag`(0 or 1).
`Flag=0` means splitted elements are to be name after the `name` attribute and if `flag=1` then elements will be give named by a number with removed whitespaces and in lowercase to maintain uniformity.
The splitted elements will be stored at the given `path`/`filename_elements`.

#### split

`split('path_of_directory','fileName',0)` - split files by their name attribute.

`split('path_of_directory','fileName',1)` - split files by indexing them from 0.

Checkout the folder `fileName_elements` in the `path_of_directory` to see files or you can use function `getFileInfo()`.

To call the function `getFileInfo(path,flag,fileName)` you will require `sd/src/utils.js`. It can be invoked with 3 parameteres and 2 of them are optional depending on task. First parameter is `path` and it is required for functionality. The second and third parameters are `flag` and `fileName`.

If `flag=1` it will return the content of all files present in the path else if `fileName` is given then it will return the content of the specified file.

If there is only one parameter that is `path` or with `flag=0` it will return list of all files present in the directory.

You can combine objects by calling function **combine()** from writeFile.js. It takes 2 parameters `path` and list of `keys_to_be_removed`.

#### combine

**combine(path, keys_to_be_removed)** - This will read all files in the given path and remove the keys given the list of keys_to_be_removed and saves it into a new file in the given `path` as name `<dirName>_combined.json`.

Example: `combine('/abc/pqr/', ['id', 'img'])`

If you want to modify the json structure of splitted files and combine them again to a single file then you can call splitObject with a call back function.

at jsonlint we should check only new generated json files.
and we need to clean up a lot of things here are not necessary. let's discuss it as well

#### Synopsis

This is a module for using generator functions as a seperate module to generate static food data files
The functions granted by this module are as follows:

//@TODO update this section

<!-- ### Generator commands
- `npm run generateFiles` or `yarn generateFiles`: generate all recipes in folder `dist`
- `npm run generateFile`  or `yarn generateFile`: generate meal on two weeks in folder `dist`
- `npm run generateArray` or `yarn generateArray`: More detailed information [here](#how-to-generate) -->

//@TODO we need to update this section

## How to generate additional files

To run generator (it will run in writeFile.js function writeFiles()) `npm run generateFiles` to know if writing is success in console you will see `file generated successfully!` it will write multiple files.

In function `writeFiles()` should be array of files. In array config of objects.
First property in object should be `name` and value filename, the second `data` and in value set function that returns data.

Also you can write one file using function `writeFile()` just give it two parameters first - `path`, second `data` that will need to write. Data should be object and JSON format.

## Generate Array API

**generateArrWithId(data, idName)** - return an array of objects, where each object has autogenerated ID.
Output:

```
[
  {
    ...item,
    id: __generatedID
  },
]
```

**getKeyArrayDepAndIng()** - returns an array of objects, where each object stores ingredient key as department key

```
[
  {
    key:String
  }
]
```
